# Introduction
Fractal is a hypnosis spiral generation program built in Node.js, Electron, and Angular and is inspired from the work by [ohgodhowdidthis/trance](https://github.com/ohgodhowdidthis/trance).

## Why?
While trance had great support for a long time in both spiral video rendering and in VR video rendering, the program fell behind in API implementation and eventually broke most VR headsets. While VR is something I want to break into with fractal, right now Fractal is just aiming to encode video spirals into an MP4 format.
